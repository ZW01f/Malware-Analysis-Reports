Mydoom is a mass-mailing worm that spread through e-mail. The worm acts as a backdoor Trojan, which allows an attacker to access the infected system. This backdoor may be used to distribute other malicious software. Some variants of Mydoom launch denial of service (DoS) attacks against specific Web sites.
